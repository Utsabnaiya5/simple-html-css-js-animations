Hello there
i am not a beginner in coding but yes u can say i am learning new things so this files contains an menu bar animation from hamburger icon 
which is simple as i used only htmll css and js no libraries and frameworks used cause i was teaching a student
but little unique u can run it to see the preview by default the buttons dont do specific task 
rather then redirect u to some randome websites.
